= Getting started

Angela provides a Java API to handle a Terracotta cluster lifecycle.
It also provides a set of utility methods to help with testing (e.g. network controlling for HA testing)

It can set up a TSA from :

 - a Kit tarball
 - the SAG installer
 - a local build

It can install the cluster locally or remotely

It can execute functions that contain client code locally or remotely

It supports TC DB and TC Ehcache

== Tsa Cluster example

Given the following cluster configuration:

[source,xml]
----
include::../resources/tc-config-a.xml[tags=servers]
----

We expect the TSA to contain one Terracotta server running on localhost, and this will be automatically resolved by Angela.
We can ask now Angela to setup such a cluster:

[source,java]
----
include::../java/GettingStarted.java[tags=configureCluster]
----
<1> Creates the TSA cluster topology
<2> Defines the Terracotta distribution : version, package type (KIT) and License (TC DB)
<3> Defines the Terracotta cluster config
<4> The license in case the distribution is enterprise
<5> Creates a Tsa logical instance that serves as an endpoint to call functionalities regarding the Tsa lifecycle
<6> Installs the Tsa from the distribution on the appropriate server(s) (localhost in this case)
<7> Starts all servers from the Tsa
<8> Install the license with the cluster tool
<9> Stops all Terracotta servers and cleans up the installation

=== Tsa API

[source,java]
----
include::../java/GettingStarted.java[tags=showTsaApi]
----
<1> install all Terracotta servers for the given topology
<2> start all Terracotta servers
<3> license all Terracotta servers
<4> get the reference of the active server. Null is returned if there is none. An exception is throw if there are more than one
<5> get the references of all active servers. Get an empty collection if there are none.
<6> get the reference of the passive server. Null is returned if there is none. An exception is throw if there are more than one
<7> get the references of all passive servers. Get an empty collection if there are none.
<8> stop all Terracotta servers
<9> start one Terracotta server
<10> stop one Terracotta server
<11> get the current state of the Terracotta server

== Client example

[source,java]
----
include::../java/GettingStarted.java[tags=runClient]
----
<1> Creates a client on a remote server (localhost in this case)
<2> executes the function on the remote client
<3> Wait until the client execution finishes
